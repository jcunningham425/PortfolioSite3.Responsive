    <h1 class="bio">About Me</h1>
    <p class="sinkinsans2">Hey there.   As I'm sure you've already figured out already, my name is Joe Cunningham and I live in Chicago.
            By day, I work full-time at a digital ad agency running paid search marketing campaigns for a major tech client.
            On my evenings and weekends, I double as a freelance web designer and developer.  Beyond that, you can usually find me
            working out at the gym or out with friends exploring our beautiful city.  I graduated from Depaul University in 2013
            with a B.A. in Advertising and live in the Lakeview area.</p>
    <p class="sinkinsans2"> Now I am sure you have some questions for me, so hopefully these will take care of most of them.</p>

    <h2 class="sinkinsans2">FAQ's:</h2>

    <h4 class="questions">What's your specialty?</h4>
    <p class="sinkinsans2">I am a front-end web developer, so your standard HTML, CSS, and jQuery are what I work with.  I am also working to
                           grow my javascript skills and dabble with Adobe Photoshop.</p>

    <h4 class="questions">What kind of sites can you build?</h4>
    <p class="sinkinsans2">I only do front-end development. So if you are looking to have an elegantly designed website for information
                            and contact purposes without spending thousands of dollars, I'm your guy.  If you need something more advanced like gathering and storing data, you are going
                            to need someone who does back-end development.</p>

    <h4 class="questions">How long and how much?</h4>
    <p class="sinkinsans2">That all depends my friend.  Email me so we can start the conversation.  I am currently looking to work with local clients in the city,
                        so I can meet you in person to discuss what you are looking for.  I work with fixed rates, not hourly.</p>

    <h4 class="questions">You say you work in paid search, will you do my marketing too?</h4>
    <p class="sinkinsans2">Sadly, no.  If you are looking to run paid search campaigns, I will help get your landing pages optimized properly, but
                            I can't run your ad campaigns.  </p>
